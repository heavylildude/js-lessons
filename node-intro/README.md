# 🏄‍♂️ Node Intro – Welcome to the Coding Beach!

G'day legend! Welcome to the **node-intro** lesson of your js-lessons repo. If you’re keen to catch some gnarly Node.js waves and learn the basics, you’re in the right spot. This doc’s the wax for your board – get prepped, get stoked, and let’s send it!

## 🛠️ Quick Start (No Worries Version)

1. **Open ya terminal/CLI**  
   Make sure Node.js and npm are installed, or you’ll wipe out before you even paddle out, brah.

2. **Cruise into your project folder:**
   ```sh
   cd [your folder]
   ```

3. **Initialize your project (no dramas):**
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install the essentials (express, body-parser, ejs):**
   ```sh
   npm install express body-parser ejs
   ```

5. **Check for `app.js`**  
   If it’s missing, that’s like forgetting your surfboard. Make sure it’s there!

6. **Launch the app:**
   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

7. **Open your browser:**  
   Cruise over to `http://127.0.0.1:<port number>` (replace `<port number>` with your actual port, legend).

## 🌊 Magnus Tips (Straight from the Coding Pipeline)

- Fact: Node.js is fast, lightweight, and perfect for backend newbies.
- Opinion: If you’re not using Express for your first server, you’re making life way harder than it needs to be, mate.
- Gen-Z Pro Tip: Don’t be afraid to break things. Debugging is just surfing the error waves till you hit the shore.
- Aussie Slang Alert: If the server borks, don’t spit the dummy. Just check your code and paddle back out.

## 🤙 What’s in the Folder?

- `app.js` – Your main Node app. It’s the boss.
- `package.json` – Keeps your dependencies and scripts sorted.
- Any other random files? Ignore ‘em for now, legend.

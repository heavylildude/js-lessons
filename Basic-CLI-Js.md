# üéÆ Level Up: The Terminal, Node, and Your First Code!

Welcome to the digital playground! Today, we're unlocking the secret language of computers.  
Think of the terminal as your **personal command center**, Node.js as the **power-up that lets you speak to it**, and JavaScript as the **spells you'll cast**.

---

## üöÄ Part 1: Your Digital Command Center

Before we start coding, we need to find our way around. Forget point-and-click; we‚Äôre going old-school, but in a super efficient way.

### **Analogy: The Terminal is Your Backpack**

Imagine your computer is a giant, magical backpack with thousands of folders and files.  
Clicking around with your mouse is like pulling things out one by one.  
The terminal is like a magic list where you can see everything, grab whatever you want, and organize your stuff with a few quick words.

---

### **Let's Get Started**

#### **Open the Terminal:**

- **Mac:** Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`).
- **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in the Start Menu. (We'll use **Git Bash** for simplicity if you have it installed).
- **Linux:** It's usually a shortcut on your desktop or in the applications menu.

#### **Basic Commands:**

***Print Working Directory** This command tells you exactly where you are in your digital backpack. It's like asking, "Where am I right now?"*
```bash
pwd
```
<hr>

***List** This shows you all the files and folders in your current location. It's like unzipping your backpack to see what's inside.*
```bash
ls
```

***Change Directory**  Use this to move into a folder.* 
```bash
cd <folder-name>
```
*For example:*
```bash
cd Documents
```
*To go back, just type:*
```bash
cd ..
```

***Make Directory** Use this to create a new folder.*
```bash
mkdir <folder-name>
```
*For example:*
```bash
mkdir my-first-code
```

***Make New File** Use this to make coffee.*
```bash
touch <file-name>
```
*DUH! For example:*
```bash
touch omagahitssocool.txt
```


***Clear** Basically wiping your screen.*
```bash
clear
```
*Tidies up the screen, getting rid of old commands so you can see things clearly.*

## ‚òï Break Time! (10 mins)

Stretch, grab a drink, and give your brain a reset. We‚Äôre about to get into the fun stuff.

---

## üíª Part 2: Your First Code Spell

Now that you can navigate, it's time to create something.  
We'll use **Node.js** to run our JavaScript code directly from the terminal.

### **Analogy: Node.js is a Translator**

Your computer doesn't naturally understand JavaScript.  
Node.js is a magical translator that takes your JavaScript code and tells the computer exactly what to do with it.

---

### **Your First File**

#### 1. **Navigate to Your New Folder:**

Use the `cd` command to get into the folder you made earlier.  
For example:
```bash
cd my-first-code
```

#### 2. **Create a File with Nano:**

We're not using a fancy editor like VS Code just yet.  
We'll use **Nano**, a super basic text editor right in the terminal.

```bash
nano app.js
```
This will open a new file named `app.js`.

#### 3. **Write Your Code:**

Inside Nano, type this code.  
It's a simple spell to make the computer say "Hello!":

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

##### **What's happening?**
- `let greeting = "Hello, world!";` ‚Üí giving a label (`greeting`) to a value (`"Hello, world!"`).
- `console.log(greeting);` ‚Üí tells Node.js, "Hey, translator, please speak out whatever is inside the greeting label."

#### 4. **Save and Exit Nano:**

- Press `Ctrl + X`
- Nano will ask if you want to save. Press `Y` for yes.
- Then press `Enter` to confirm the filename.

#### 5. **Run Your Code!**

Back in the terminal, run your file:

```bash
node app.js
```

**Boom!** You should see `Hello, world!` printed right there.  
You just cast your first code spell.

## ‚ú® Part 3: Lexical Structure & Playtime

Now let's break down the spell a bit more and have some fun.  
We'll make the computer say whatever we want.

### **Analogy: Code is a Story**

JavaScript has rules, just like a story has grammar.  
You need to use the right words and punctuation so the computer understands.

---

### **Quick Breakdown:**

- **Variables:**  
  ```javascript
  let myName = "Chris";
  ```
  A variable is a container for a value.  
  `let` is how you declare it, `myName` is the name, and `"Chris"` is the value.

- **Strings:**  
  `"Chris"`
  This is a string‚Äîjust text. Always put text inside quotes.

- **Numbers:**  
  ```javascript
  let score = 100;
  ```
  Numbers don‚Äôt need quotes.

- **console.log():**  
  This is your "print to the screen" command.  
  It's how you make the computer show you something.

---

### **Hands-on Challenge:**

- Open `app.js` again with `nano app.js`.
- Change the code to something else.
- Try making a new variable with your name.
- Try a variable with a number.
- Try combining them in `console.log()`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let myName = "Chris";
let age = 25;
let c = "oi";
console.log("My name is " + myName + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
console.log(c);
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl + X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

Run it with:
```bash
node app.js
```
and see your new magic!

## üèÜ You've Slayed!

You've learned how to command your computer, write and run your first code, and understand the basic grammar of JavaScript.  
You're not just a user anymore‚Äîyou're a creator.  
The terminal is your oyster, and this is just the start of your journey. Bet.

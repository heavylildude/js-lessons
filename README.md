## 🛠️ Getting Set Up (No Worries, Mate!)

#### 1. You’ll Need Node.js (Legendary Tool for JavaScript)
Trust me, Node.js is your golden ticket.
Download it from the official spot here: nodejs.org
Grab the LTS version (that’s the “Long Term Support” one—super chill, less drama).
Run the installer (just click through, no stress).
How to Check Node Installed Properly
Crack open your terminal and type:

```
node -v
```
or
```
node --version
```
*Notice the diff? Should spit out a version number, like v20.10.0. If ya see that, you’re sweet!*

#### 2. Terminal: Your Power Shack
> Mac:
Hit ⌘ + Space and type “Terminal”, then enter.
Or, surf to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.


> Windows:
Press Win + S, type “cmd” or “Terminal”, hit enter.
For the cool vibes, try “Windows Terminal” from the Microsoft Store.

> Linux:
Hit Ctrl + Alt + T, or look for “Terminal” in your app menu.
Mate, once you’ve got Node and your terminal open, you’re set to shred some code!
(And if something’s sus, flick me a message—I’ll sort you out.)

## 📣 Final Yarn

If you dig this, chuck us a ⭐️!  
If you don’t, that’s chill, but maybe grab a coffee and try again tomorrow, eh?

*ps. there are no specific path of which lesson should you go first, but the basic-cli would be a nice start*

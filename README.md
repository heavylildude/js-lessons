## 🛠️ Getting Set Up (No Worries, Mate!)

#### 1. You’ll Need Node.js (Legendary Tool for JavaScript)
Trust me, Node.js is your golden ticket.
Download it from the official spot here: nodejs.org
Grab the LTS version (that’s the “Long Term Support” one—super chill, less drama).
Run the installer (just click through, no stress).

How to Check Node Installed Properly
Crack open your terminal and type:

```
node -v
```
or
```
node --version
```
*Notice the diff? Should spit out a version number, like v20.10.0. If ya see that, you’re sweet!*

#### 2. Terminal: Your Power Shack
> Mac:
Hit ⌘ + Space and type “Terminal”, then enter.
Or, surf to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

> Windows:
Press Win + S, type “cmd” or “Terminal”, hit enter.
For the cool vibes, try “Windows Terminal” from the Microsoft Store.

> Linux:
Hit Ctrl + Alt + T, or look for “Terminal” in your app menu.
Mate, once you’ve got Node and your terminal open, you’re set to shred some code!
(And if something’s sus, flick me a message—I’ll sort you out.)

## 🤙 Wanna Code on Android? Termux to the Rescue!

Stuck without a laptop? No dramas, brah — you can run all this JS goodness straight from your Android using [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)!

### 🛠️ Quick Setup Guide

1. **Download Termux (Stable APK)**
   - Grab the latest legit APK (no beta, no sketchy stuff) [right here on GitHub Releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest/download/termux-app.apk).
   - Smash that link, download the APK, and open it once it’s done.

2. **Install Termux**
   - Tap the downloaded APK in your notifications or “Downloads” folder.
   - If your phone whinges about permissions, just go to Settings and flick the toggle to allow installs from unknown sources (don’t stress, Termux is safe as houses).

3. **Fire Up Termux**
   - Open Termux from your app drawer — you'll land in a fresh terminal, ready to rip.

4. **Install Node.js**
   - Copy-paste this command and send it (easy as):
     ```sh
     pkg install node
     ```
   - Wait a sec while it sorts itself out.

5. **Clone This Repo & Go Surfing the Code**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/heavylildude/js-lessons.git
   cd js-lessons
   ```

And you’re all set, mate! Run your JavaScript, build rad stuff, and show off to your mates — all from your pocket. 🤙

> _Magnus' opinion:_ Running code on Android is peak innovation and ultimate flex. If you can code from the loo, you’re basically unstoppable. Just don’t drop your phone in the dunny, yeah?
